# BlogDraw-Updater
This is an update script for BlogDraw.  It is designed to work with "vanilla", or unmodified versions of BlogDraw.  If you have modified the code for your own use, we advise you check that there's no conflicts between your code and ours before you update.

## How to use it:
1. Download the latest release of the software (From the "Releases" link under the "Code" tab on GitHub) as a Zip File
2. Upload the directory from within that zip, with the name like "update-x.x.x-codename-x.x.x-codename" to the "web root" of your BlogDraw installation (the directory where you'll find index.php and functions.php)
3. Navigate to your-website.yourdomain/update-x-x-x-codename-x-x-x-codename/update.php in your web browser.  For example: `https://blogdraw.com/update-0-0-1-alpha-2-0-0-1-beta-1/update.php`.
4. Wait for the update to finish.  It'll tell you when it's ready.
5. delete the directory you uploaded in step 2, it's now done and won't be needed
6. Enjoy your new blogging platform.

Thank you for using BlogDraw.
